# Python Mini Projects ðŸš€  

This repository is a collection of **20 progressively harder Python projects**, built to practice **end-to-end coding** without relying on AI assistance.  
The goal is to strengthen my ability to design, write, and debug complete programs while learning useful real-world skills for **AI/ML, hardware/software, and system-level development**.

## ðŸ“‚ Structure  
Each project has its own folder:  
Inside each folder:  
- `main.py` â€” the program code  
- `README.md` â€” description, usage, and examples  
- `requirements.txt` â€” external dependencies (if any)  
- Sample input/output files (if relevant)

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals  

- Build **coding confidence** in Python without AI/code-completion.  
- Create a **professional GitHub portfolio** showing growth & progression.  
- Reinforce **DSA fundamentals** by applying them inside small but real programs.  
- Prepare for **AI/ML + hardware/software engineering internships** by practicing practical coding.
